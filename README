Simple GUI for showing hardware information and configuring the Lenovo Yoga C630
arm64 Qualcomm laptop. This First commit is an early draft but still usefull.
More to come. This assumes you have a newer patched c630 kernel with cpu turbo
boost support, soon ath10k debug will be required plus others. I suggest using
mine;
https://github.com/bm16ton/yoga-c630-linux-kernel
   or steevs
https://github.com/steev/linux-1/tree/c630-5.9
   kernels. I have a 16ton_defconfig that should work nicely

Install;
First make sure you have gtkdialog installed from;
https://github.com/bm16ton/gtkdialog.git

or from within this repo you can simply run;

sudo ./install-gtkdialog.sh

then install the scripts;

sudo ./install.sh


to remove

sudo ./uninstall.sh



So far this Shows a ton of info about hardware from /sys
allows checking status, starting, stoping remoteprocs
brings up the interconnect graph
enable/disable debug on venus enocders/decoders
One click reinstall of venus firmware after linux-firmware update replaces them
Enable disable cpu turbo/boost freqs

Hopefully lots more to come with prepackged fixes etc.
